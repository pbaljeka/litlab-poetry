ALMIGHTY God, give us grace that we may cast away the works of darkness, and put upon us the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life in which thy Son Jesus Christ came to visit us in great humility; that in the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty to judge both the quick and the dead, we may rise to the life immortal; through him who liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, one God, now and for ever.

BLESSED Lord, who hast caused all holy Scriptures to be written for our learning; Grant that we may in such wise hear them, read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest them, that by patience and comfort of thy holy Word, we may embrace, and ever hold fast, the blessed hope of everlasting life, which thou hast given us in our Saviour Jesus Christ.

O LORD Jesus Christ, who at thy first coming didst send thy messenger to prepare thy way before thee; Grant that the ministers and stewards of thy mysteries may likewise so prepare and make ready thy way, by turning the hearts of the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, that at thy second coming to judge the world we may be found an acceptable people in thy sight, who livest and reignest with the Father and the Holy Spirit ever, one God, world without end.

ALMIGHTY God, who bast given us thy only begotten Son, the brightness of thy glory, and the express image of thy person, to take our nature upon him, and to be born of a pure virgin; Grant that we being regenerate, and made thy children by adoption and grace, may daily be renewed by thy Holy Spirit; till Christ be perfectly formed in us, and we be made partakers of a Divine nature, through the same our Lord Jesus Christ who liveth and reigneth with thee and the same Spirit, ever one God, world without end.

GRANT, O Lord, that in all our sufferings here upon earth for the testimony of thy truth, we may stedfastly look up to heaven, and by faith behold the glory that shall be revealed; and, being filled with the Holy Ghost, may learn to love and bless our persecutors by the example of thy first Martyr Saint Stephen, who prayed for his murderers to thee, O blessed Jesus, who standest at the right hand of God to succour all those that suffer for thee, our only Mediator and Advocate.

MERCIFUL God, who art light, and in whom is no darkness at all; Enlighten our minds, we most humbly beseech Thee, with such a full understanding of the doctrine taught by thy blessed Apostle and Evangelist John that we, walking in the truth and all purity and holiness of life, may have fellowship with thee and thy Son Jesus Christ; by whose blood being cleansed from all our sins we may at length attain to everlasting life; through the same our Lord Jesus Christ.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who dost govern all things in heaven and earth; Mercifully hear the supplications of thy people, and so rule and guide us that we may do our duties faithfully in the several places and relations: constantly abhorring that which is evil, and cleaving to that which is good; being fervent in spirit, serving the Lord, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, and continuing so instant in prayer, that we may enjoy thy peace all the days of our life; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, mercifully look upon our infirmities, and endue us with the spirit of meekness and patience; that no evil we suffer from others may move us to do evil unto them, but we may overcome them by doing them good, and if it he possible, as much as lieth in us, live peaceably with all men.

ALMIGHTY and everlasting God, who hatest nothing that thou hast made, and dost forgive the sins of all them that are penitent; Create and make in us new and contrite hearts, that we truly lamenting our sins, with unfeigned sorrow and abhorrence, and acknowledging our wretchedness, with sincere resolution of amendment of life, may obtain of thee, the God of all mercy, perfect remission and forgiveness; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

ALMIGHTY God, who seest that we have no power of ourselves to help ourselves: Keep us both outwardly in our bodies, and inwardly in our souls; that we may be defended from all adversities which may happen to the body and from all evil thoughts which may assault and hurt the soul; and as we have received how we ought to walk and please thee, so we may abound more and more; through our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. 

WE beseech thee, Almighty God, look upon the hearty desires of thy humble servants, and as thou hast enlightened us with the knowledge of thy truth, so enable us to walk as children of the light, and to have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness; that bringing forth the fruits of the Spirit, in all goodness, righteousness, and truth, we may be ever under thy divine protection; through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Grant this for the sake of thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ.

ALMIGHTY God the father of mercies, we beseech thee graciously to hear the prayers of thy Church, for which our Lord Jesus Christ was content to be betrayed and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross; and according to that new covenant, which he sealed there with his precious blood, put thy laws into all our hearts, and write them in our minds; and then remember our sins and iniquities no more; for the sake of him, who, when he had offered one sacrifice for sin, for ever sat down on thy right hand, and now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Ghost, ever one God, world without end.
