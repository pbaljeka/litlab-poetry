According to medieval theory, the cursus was used at tile ends 
of the commata, cola, and periodus (or conclusio), the parts, large 
or small, of which a rhetorical period is constructed. (4)

In practice, I will try to show, it was not used 
only in the final positions.

One is to include in the number all rhetorical 
divisions of a period (all the Sunday collects consist of a single 
period, that is, a single articulated sentence), however short, all 
the commata and cola, that is, which according to Latin rule might 
have cursus-endings.

The only other natural process is 
to count those divisions of a prayer which are indicated by semi- 
colons in the authorized editions.

There would be advantages in each method; but I choose the latter, 
the method of counting the pauses marked by semi-colons, because 
it eliminates the necessity of doubtful decisions.

The result, it must be said, is not favorable to Shelly's conclu- 
sions. Of the 113 endings occurring at the places described only 
43, or 38%o 
of the whole number, are in the three forms, according 
to the strictest possible interpretation of the requirements of these 
forms; only 45, or 40%, according to the freest interpretation of 
them.9




the cadences occur in English where there are 
none in Latin and vice versa.

The purpose of the two following chapters 
of this paper will be to show that he has limited too narrowly the 
area in which we may properly look for the influence of the cursus 
in the Collects, in the first place in his study of the forms of English 
cadence, and in the second place in his ideas concerning the places 
where cadence may occur.

There are three variations of the regular Latin forms which 
would be most likely to appear with frequency if the translators 
worked in the free way we have described. 

1. The endinog 
velox would easily become 8 -4 -2 in English, 
and woitud 
not lose its essential character in so doing. Some ex- 
amples are:-carry us through all temptations (4th Sun. aft. Ep.); 
defended by thy mighty power (5th Sun. aft. Ep.); partakers of 
thy resurrection (Sun. bef. East.); the weakness of our mortal 
nature (Tr. Sun.); declarest thy almighty power (1lth Sun. aft. 
Tr.); continually to be given (17th Sun. aft. Tr.). 

2. Velox again could be modified by the addition of a light 
syllable at the end, the form tlhus becoming 8-5-3 instead of 
7 - 4- 2, or 9 - 5 - 3 instead of 8 - 4 - 2. This is a very common 
ending:-defend us from all adversities (Tr. Sun.) ; serve thee in 
all godly quietness (5th Sun. aft. Tr.) ; return into the way of 
righteousness (3d Sun. aft. East.) ; always prevent and follow us 14 
(17th Sun. aft. Tr.) ; visit us in great humility (lst Sun. in Adv.); 
the example of his great humility (Sun. bef. East.); our defence 
against all our enemies (3d Sun. in Lent); protection of thy good 
Providence (2d Sun. aft. Tr.); hearts of the disobedient (3d Sun. 
in Adv.). 

3. Tardus would often become 7 - 3 instead of 6 - 3. This is 
in fact the commoner form, I believe, in elevated prose; and cer- 
tainly some of the most beautiful phrases in the prayer-book owe 
their character to it. Examples are:-several necessities (All 
Cond. of Men); dangers and adversities (3d Sun. aft. Tr.); 
troubles and adversities (Collect in the Litany); free from all ad- 
versities (22d Sun. aft. Tr.); acknowledging our wretchedness 
(Ash-Wed.); ordered by thy governance (5th Sun. aft. Tr.); 
never-failing Providence (8th Sun. aft. Tr.). 



What are the reasons then for accepting this principle; that is, 
for expecting the three variations, and perhaps still others, to 
appear in English as equivalents of the regular Latin forms? 
There are two, both derived from differences between the two lan- 
guages: the first from a difference in the character of their words, 
the second from a difference in their metrical character and cus- 
toms. 
I. English is far less polysyllabic than Latin. It had been so 
even in its classical Anglo-Saxon form, in the period when Anglo- 
Saxon was enjoying its highest courtly ana literary cultivation; 
and with the loss of inflections which attended its rapid decline


The only point to be made here, however, is the more general one 
that in as far as this process of Latinization of the vocabulary had 
gone on it was possible to have the cadences in English,-and no 
furtlher. Native English was not of a character to lend itself to 
them, aind it had become still more foreign to them during the 
period of its decline.


[SECONDARY STRESS:]
This point may first be illustrated by a rather full consideration 
of velox. This form is very inadequately represented by the for- 
mula 7-4-2, _uuvu-- u for it is of its essence that the accent 
on 4 shall be subordinate to that on 2, and the characteristic case 
of it is that in which it ends in a four- or five-syllable word, with 
the main accent on the penult, and hence (according to Latin rule) 
a subordinate accent on the second syllable preceding. Thus- 
et ad implenda quae viderint convalescant (lst Sun. aft. Ep.); 
misericorditer liberemur (Sept. Sun).



[LATIN WORDS:]
And, 
moreover, it is to be observed that there were not so many of them 
in the middle of the sixteentlh century as thlere 
are now. Not many 
can be gathered from the prayer-book 
itself :-confirmation, media- 
tion, resurrection, supplications, satisfaction, regeneration, circum- 
cision, advantageous and a few others, nearly all words in -ion or 
else words that are not likely to occur at the ends of phrases.'


[VELOX]
Again: In the case of the two-word phrases ending a velox, as 
mortal nature, faithful servants, etc., there is a departure from 
the exact Latin effect, but in the opposite direction from that just 
mentioned. That is, there is here a tendency to put too strong an 
accent on the adjective, and hence to give too mueh importance to 
the minor accent of the cadence

This effect will not be produced, however, if the last accent of the 
cadence is followed by two unaccented syllables instead of by one, 
because the lengthening of this unaccented part of the period has 
the effect of strengthening its accent, and the minor accent of the 
preceding period is thus relatively reduced. Defend us from all 
adversities, our defence against all our enemies, and serve thee in 
all godly quietness are better reproductions of velox than phrases 
of the form 7 - 4 - 2 would be in their places.


The syllable-counting custom of medieval Latin gives a 
definite inalterable value to each unaccented syllable of a metrical 
unit; and a slight difference between the number of such syllables 
in one part of a cadence and another, between the two of the first 
period of velox, for instance, and the one of each of its other 
periods, may be depended upon to produce an effect and establish a 
desired relation between the parts.


It follows that English cadence can never be pro- 
erly described by a numerical system, and that it can never produce 
the same effect as the Latin cadence unless it is allowed a certain 
freedom in its use of unaccented syllables.




[THE PERIOD]

1. There is no better definition of the period than Hobbes' curt 
translation of Aristotle in his Brief of the Art of Rhetorick 
(1681) : 26 " A period is such a part as is perfect in itself, and has 
such length as may easily be comprehended by the understanding." 
Aristotle's statement in full (Rhetoric, iii, ch. 9) is as follows: 
"I call a period a form of words which has independently in itself 
a beginning and ending, and a length easily taken in at a glance."
	not a syntactic or logical unit, but on the one hand a psycho- 
	logical, and on the other a rhythmical, unit.28



2. The parts of a divided period are called members (membra) 
or cola (in medieval Latin also distinctiones or versus), and the 
number of these that may constitute a period is undefined


The " harmony," " number," or " rhythm " of a period depends 
chiefly upon the relations between the members of which it consists: 
relations of length, form, and sound.


3. Some theorists give a place in the doctrine of the period to a 
phenomenon which is very frequent in every oratorical style in 
which there is a certain amplitude and dignity, namely, the com- 
bination of two members, related to each other syntactically in 
certain ways, to form a larger unit within the period. This double 
unit, consisting of two members, is called a phrase

Unless there are at least two phrases, 
balanced in form, we may describe the period as consisting merely 
of members.



4. A colon of a certain length may fall into two (sometimes even 
three) parts in utterance, the division between them being indicated 
by a pause shorter than that at the end of a colon. One of these 
parts, which, however, like the phrases, never occur singly, is called 
a comma (caesum, incisum, or sometimes in medieval Latin sub- 
distinctio). The division of the colon into commata is not con- 
nected apparently with the physiological process of breathing, or at 
least is not primarily due to this, but is chiefly the effect of a law 
of beauty of sound which seems to demand such a break

It corresponds, that is, to the division of the 
line made by the cesura in formal verse.80








The fact is that the neglect of this study has 
been due to the tendency to avoid the oratorical models on which 
all the theory of rhetoric is formed, and to consider prose chiefly 
as it is addressed to the intellect, rather than as language spoken 
and heard. The characteristic prose of the nineteenth century 
has been the essay, rather than the address; and even in the eigh- 
teenth century, the great authority of the Addisonian model of 
style, especially as it was described in Blair's widely-used rhetoric, 
tended to outweigh the influence of Johnson, Gibbon, Burke, Rob- 
ertson, and other writers of the latter part of the century, who 
wrote the more copious and sonorous language of oratory.




The English Collects themselves are the best possible corpus for 
such an experiment, first, because they fulfill ideally the conditions 
of an oral prose, and secondly, because they are made in close 
rhetorical imitation of Latin models in which the formal rules of 
the period were observed.



We may be sure that a science of the rhythmic period will 
never be discovered. And if it is true that even in our older prose, 
composed in the regular manner of the rhetorical tradition, we 
often find it necessary to defend by an appeal to personal preference 
our choice of this or that reading, it is certain that the reader will 
find an ever-widening range for the exercise of his artistic gifts of 
interpretation as he approaches the prose of our own time.



[PHRASES!]
The end of any phrase felt as having a unitary character may 
be cadenced, whether or not it coincides with the end of one of the 
divisions of a period. 


1. A very simple type is that which consists of a noun preceded 
by its adjective.


2. More interesting is the phrase in which two words, often 
synonyms, are connected by and


3. The prepositional phrase, that is, a noun, adjective, or verb
with a prepositional modifier following it, is an equally common 
form:





The point urged in this section of my paper certainly does not 
tend to simplify the subject of cadence. It tends rather to blur 
and disarrange some of the definite lines that have been drawn 
about it heretofore.
The same remark may be made, indeed, about 
the preceding section; for the doctrine of the period, though it 
seems to be the only trustworthy guide through the uncertainties 
of cadence-occurrence, 
is itself full of uncertainties, difficulties, and 
problems








When velox may vary in length from 
seven to ten, or even more syllables, and its later accents move about 
as freely as we have been asserting they may, the method of scansion 
becomes absurd. It is true that a table might still be made of the 
forms that produce the required effect, and those that do not, but 
it is far simpler to state general rules which will allow for all the 
varieties of forms that we have discovered.









The rules, then., are as follows: 

1. The English cadence ordinarily begins on one of the syllables 
five to ten, counting from the end. It never begins later than the 
fifth, but sometimes the long cadence may begin as far back as the 
eleventh syllable, as in 11 - 7 - 3, or even on the twelfth, as in 
12 - 8 -4. These are, however, extreme cases. 

2. The first accent is the strongest in the cadence, as marking 
its beginning. It is the climax as to height of pitch and strength 
of accent of the member in which the cadence occurs, and indicates 
the point at which the tendency to rhythmical form always observ- 
able in oratory, but restrained earlier in the phrase by the necessities 
of logical statement, is finally allowed to appear without check.

3. At this point a trochaic movement begins which carries 
through to the end of the phrase and cadence. The trochaic move- 
ment of the English cadence is alone enough to mark the influence 
of the classical cadences upon it, for it is not the nature of English 
prose, except under this influence, to keep to the same movement 
(rising or falling) throughout a phrase.

It inclines to shift from 
one to the other, and perhaps prefers, on the whole, to end in a 
rising movement rather than a falling one. 


4. Each cadence has two accents, of which the first is stronger 
than the second, and is followed by a greater number of unaccented 
syllables, or by an equal number of syllables which makes the effect 
of being greater, than the second. Stated differently, this law is 
that there is an effect of decreasing length of period and strength 
of accent from the beginning of a cadence to the end

 
5. If the number of syllables following an accent exceeds three 
a secondary subsidiary accent appears. This rule applies in practice 
only to the period of the first accent because if the second period 
contained more than four syllables it could not seem shorter than 
the first (see rule 4); that is, this rule explains the form of the long 
cadence

Velox in 
Latin is a binary rhythm, the accent on 4 being only of importance
as serving to prop up or carry on the long run of syllables between 
the accent on 7 and the accent on 2.


If they are 
observed with the utmost freedom allowable to English rythmical 
custom, they still produce cadences which have the essential rhyth-
mical-though not the exact metrical-character of these three 
Latin cadences. 









Cadence, then, is perhaps the euphonious way of accompanying 
in speech this natural fall or subsidence of energy.


Since we have drifted so 
far from these actual metrical schemes in following the facts of 
English practice, is it not safer to assume that the rules merely 
describe a necessary and universal tendency of oratorical style, and 
that the frequent occurrence in English of the exact metrical form 
of the Latin cursus is due, not to medieval tradition, but to the 
fact that these forms are the perfect and simplest manifestation of 
this tendency?
